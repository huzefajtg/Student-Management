Student-ManagementStudent Management System is my personal project for the purpose of presentation to an interviewer to present my knowledge on ASP.Net Core,Ms-SQL Server, Angular CLI, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc.In this project there are 2 main stakeholder Teachers and Students. Teachers can Login and check home page for updates happening to their students(basically acts as a notification) there teacher can check how many new students have applied for their course, teachers can also update their details,they can search for students (teacher's own student or other) or teachers and view their details, all details regarding teacher are approved by the Head Of Department (HOD) of the course who are also teachers. Students also have similar Home page to recieve updates like Notices or Home work etc, they can also search for teachers and view their details. Students can also update their own details.
